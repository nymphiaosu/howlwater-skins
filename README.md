# HowlWater skins
highly unfinished will do when i feel like it

you might notice that most of the skins here are basically repeats with little to no differences to each other, thats a howl thing dont blame me ü§∑

the skins listed will have 4 categories that will be represented by a specific character: 
## Authentic ‚òÖ: 
this means the skin came directly from howl/affiliates

## Remasters ‚ÅÇ: 
this indicates that the skin has been slightly altered to be made into high resolution via either manual remaking of each element/finding out the origins of certain elements, or by ai upscaling, the origin of the skin being remastered isnt accounted for

## Remakes ¬ß:
these skins were never released, but were seen being used by howl in one form or another. the elements were remade with the least amount of innaccuracies using things like thumbnails, reddit screenshots, memory of people affiliated, etc

## Speculation ?:
these are skins that people claim to be howl's yet have no (confirmed) evidence of them being used by him, if you're only looking for CONFIRMED howl skins i suggest u ignore the skins marked with these

only thing that was remade is the cursortrail and the colors, had to guesstimate the cursortrail but i'm pretty sure the sliderborder is as close to perfect as i can get it
